						<h2>What's The Main Idea?</h2>
						<p>Have you ever owned a security camera system and wished you could get more out of it than just mere recording and notification alerts? Possibly have the camera take a picture at a particular instance? Or perhaps the camera system on and off with just your voice? Ideas such a these are what motivated this RaspCam project. The goal was to develop a feedback security system that is very user-friendly and easily operated with the incorporation of the Google Assistant, using a simple device such as a Raspberry Pi along with a camera module, USB microphone and speakers. At the mention of the hotword “Ok Google”, the user will be able to voice out a set of device-specific commands (through the microphone) that have been programmed into the Google Assistant library, to accomplish various tasks such as turn on/off the camera, take a snapshot of the camera’s current view, request a daily summary of the camera’s activity, while simultaneously receiving email notifications for each command. In addition to the custom commands that have been added to the library, the RaspCam still supports native commands of the Google Assistant. This therefore enables the user to interact with the camera just as they would with any other Google Assistant-supported device. </p>
